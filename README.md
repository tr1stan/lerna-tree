# Lerna Tree

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To regenerate a newer version of the `tree.json` file, clone the [react-shared-components](https://github.com/mergermarket/react-shared-components) repo and run the command

`yarn workspaces info > tree.json`. You then manually removing the first and last lines and then copying over the file for the moment... (It's a hack day)
